# ImageJ Scripts
In this repository are stored *ImageJ* scripts that were developed for automated microfossil images processing and segmentation.

* **MorFo_.ijm**: Automated processing of a folder of images that will binarise them, separate particles that are in contact with each other, measure several morphological parameters for each particle, and export processed images and results in two tables: one for each particle, and one for each sample (averaged).

**Ni Vision / LabView Scripts**

* **PoreViewG.vascr**: Automated processing of images of crushed benthic foraminifera *Globobulimina* species that will binarise the original images, reconstruct the tests' fragments and measure their porosity. It will export the results in a table.
