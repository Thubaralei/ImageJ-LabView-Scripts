# ImageJ Scripts
In this repository are stored *ImageJ* scripts that were developed for automated microfossil images processing and segmentation.

* **MorFo_.ijm**: Automated processing of a folder of images (**a**) that will binarise them, separate particles that are in contact with each other (**b**), measure several morphological parameters for each particle (**c**), and export processed images and results in two tables: one for each particle, and one for each sample (averaged).

**Ni Vision / LabView Scripts**

* **PoreViewG.vascr**: Automated processing of images of crushed benthic foraminifera *Globobulimina* species that will binarise the original images (**a** and **b**), reconstruct the tests' fragments and measure their porosity(**c**). It will export the results in a table. The .zip file contain the .vascr script and a .docx description of the script.
